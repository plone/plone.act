Plone ACT -- functional tests for Plone made easy
=================================================

**plone.act** and its documentation gives you everything to get started in
writing and executing functional Selenium tests (including acceptance tests)
for your Plone add-on.

**plone.act** performs functional testing by using two testing frameworks:
`Robot Framework <http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/>`_ and
`Selenium <http://seleniumhq.org/>`_.

Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing
and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), even for behavior driven
development (BDD). It has easy-to-use plain text test syntax and utilizes the
keyword-driven testing approach. Selenium is a web browser automation framework
that exercises the browser as if the user was interacting with the browser.
